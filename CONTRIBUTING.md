## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ewu-course-tool.git
cd ewu-course-tool/tool

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the tool
python main.py
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes

### Example Function

```python
def fetch_courses(session_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Fetch course data from EWU portal
    
    Args:
        session_id: Active session ID from authentication
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing status and courses list
        
    Raises:
        ConnectionError: If unable to connect to portal
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

**Examples:**
```
